# awscli-instance-task
This is my first creation of instance via aws command line

This repo contains script file which create t2 instance and deploy Docker with two containers - mySQL and Java

To create your instance you must have AWS accaunt, created individual IAM user, know his Access Key Id and Secret Access Key.

Folow the script questions and goodluck ;)
